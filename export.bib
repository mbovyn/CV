abstract = {Formation of fluid filled lumen by epithelial tissues is a fundamental process for organ development. How epithelial cells regulate the hydraulic and cortical forces to control lumen morphology is not completely understood. Here, we quantified the mechanical role of tight junctions in lumen formation using genetically modified MDCKII cysts. We found that the paracellular ion barrier formed by claudin receptors is not required for hydraulic inflation of lumen. However, depletion of the zonula occludens scaffold resulted in lumen collapse and folding of apical membranes. Combining quantitative measurements and perturbations of hydrostatic lumen pressure and junctional tension with modelling, we were able to predict lumen morphologies from the pressure-tension force balance. We found that in MDCK tissue the tight junction promotes formation of spherical lumen by decreasing cortical tension via inhibition of myosin. In addition, we found that the apical surface area of cells is largely uncoupled from lumen volume changes, suggesting that excess apical area contributes to lumen opening in the low-pressure regime. Overall, our findings provide a mechanical understanding of how epithelial cells use tight junctions to modulate tissue and lumen shape.},

abstract = {<p>Hepatocytes grow their apical surfaces anisotropically to generate a 3D network of bile canaliculi (BC). BC elongation is ensured by apical bulkheads, membrane extensions that traverse the lumen and connect juxtaposed hepatocytes. We hypothesize that apical bulkheads are mechanical elements that shape the BC lumen in liver development but also counteract elevated biliary pressure. Here, by resolving their structure using STED microscopy, we found that they are sealed by tight junction loops, connected by adherens junctions, and contain contractile actomyosin, characteristics of mechanical function. Apical bulkheads persist at high pressure upon microinjection of fluid into the BC lumen, and laser ablation demonstrated that they are under tension. A mechanical model based on ablation results revealed that apical bulkheads double the pressure BC can hold. Apical bulkhead frequency anticorrelates with BC connectivity during mouse liver development, consistent with predicted changes in biliary pressure. Our findings demonstrate that apical bulkheads are load-bearing mechanical elements that could protect the BC network against elevated pressure.</p>},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells are divided into a complex system of compartments, with their spatial organization ever-changing to enable cell functions. For example, in neurons, packages of neurotransmitters are transported from the cell body, down axons, to synapses, where their delivery mediates learning and memory. Phagosomes are transported to meet lysosomes, which fuse to kill pathogens. We know a great deal about the kinesin, dynein, and myosin molecular motors which do mechanical work to drive this motion, as well as the microtubule and actin tracks they are transported along. However, how the many different cargos in a cell are transported using largely the same sets of motors and tracks, but to different outcomes, remains largely a mystery. To understand how cargos can be directed, we build a model of cargo movement at the scale of a cargo. We build a simple model of how motors work from the details known in vitro, then incorporate the physics of a small solid body in a fluid. We apply this model to give insight into several problems. We show that when two microtubules cross at an intersection, they interact with motor and cargo dynamics to dictate outcomes that depend on geometry of the intersection. In another study, we show that organization of motors on the cargo surface can drive different transport outcomes. When motors are attached rigidly to the surface of a cargo, the cargo faces a tradeoff between fast binding and efficient transport. However, when motors are free to diffuse in the cargo membrane, both are possible. In a third study, we take and analyze data on how cargos bind in vitro, and show that a mismatch between model prediction and experimental outcomes provides insight into the behavior of motor molecules. Overall, these studies show that looking at intracellular cargos as 3D objects can provide insight into how cargo transport functions in the cell, as well as providing a bedrock for understanding how and why cells may manipulate the behaviors that emerge from the individual components when they are put together.},

abstract = {Cellular cargos, including lipid droplets and mitochondria, are transported along microtubules using molecular motors such as kinesins. Many experimental and computational studies focused on cargos with rigidly attached motors, in contrast to many biological cargos that have lipid surfaces that may allow surface mobility of motors. We extend a mechanochemical 3D computational model by adding coupled-viscosity effects to compare different motor arrangements and mobilities. We show that organizational changes can optimize for different objectives: Cargos with clustered motors are transported efficiently, but are slow to bind to microtubules, whereas those with motors dispersed rigidly on their surface bind microtubules quickly, but are transported inefficiently. Finally, cargos with freely-diffusing motors have both fast binding and efficient transport, although less efficient than clustered motors. These results suggest that experimentally observed changes in motor organization may be a control point for transport.[Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text]},

abstract = {Molecular motors like kinesin are critical for cellular organization and biological function including in neurons. There is detailed understanding of how they move and how factors such as applied force and the presence of microtubule-associated proteins can alter this single-motor travel. In order to walk, the cargo-motor complex must first attach to a microtubule. This attachment process is less studied. Here, we use a combination of single-molecule bead experiments, modeling, and simulation to examine how cargos with kinesin-1 bind to microtubules. In experiment, we find that increasing cargo size and environment viscosity both signficantly slow cargo binding time. We use modeling and simulation to examine how the single motor on rate translates to the on rate of the cargo. Combining experiment and modeling allows us to estimate the single motor on rate as 100 s −1. This is a much higher value than previous estimates. We attribute the difference between our measurements and previous estimates to two factors: first, we are directly measuring initial motor attachment (as opposed to re-binding of a second motor) and second, the theoretical framework allows us to account for missed events (i.e. binding events not detected by the experiments due to their short duration). This indicates that the mobility of the cargo itself, determined by its size and interaction with the cytoplasmic environment, play a previously underestimated role in determining intracellular transport kinetics.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells transport cargos along microtubules to control their distribution within the cell and deliver them to distant locations. While we understand how molecular motors can transport cargos along individual microtubules, the cell's microtubules are usually arranged in a complex 3D network. While traversing this network, cargos need to navigate intersections where microtubules cross at a wide variety of separation distances and angles. To gain insight into how cargos navigate these intersections, we have used a recently established 3D construction technique based on holographic optical trapping to build single 3D microtubule intersections in vitro with relevant nanoscale precision. We then used these fully suspended microtubule structures to perform motility assays on kinesin-1 coated cargos. We find that some intersection geometries influence cargos to pass along their current microtubule, while other geometries influence them to switch to the intersecting one. To understand how, we use a 3D Brownian dynamics simulation of cargo transport to investigate the mechanisms which give rise to the observed switching probabilities. Using these stochastic simulations, we find that switching probability is often determined by a competition between a stronger motor team on the primary microtubule and the intersecting microtubule sterically hindering that team's progress. This understanding of the basic mechanisms of switching at single intersections in 3D helps lay a foundation for understanding how the cell may regulate switching to control how cargos navigate the MT network and ultimately their spatial organization.},

abstract = {Cellular cargos, including lipid droplets and mitochondria, are transported along microtubules using molecular motors such as kinesins. In the cell, it is unclear how motors are coordinated to achieve transport outcomes that are cargo-specific. One possibility is that transport is modulated by differences in organization and mobility of motors on the cargo's surface. We use mechanochemical 3D computational modeling to compare different motor anchoring modes, and find that organizational changes can optimize for different objectives. Cargos with clustered motors are transported efficiently, but are slow to bind to microtubules. Cargos with motors dispersed rigidly on their surface bind microtubules quickly, but are transported inefficiently. Cargos with freely-diffusing motors have both fast binding and efficient transport, although less efficient than clustered motors. These results point to a functional role for observed changes in motor organization on cargos, and suggest motor diffusivity as a control point for transport, either by modulation of adaptor proteins or changes in lipid composition.

Author summary The molecular motors of the kinesin family are responsible for moving the parts of cells to their subcellular destinations, organizing the cell interior. Computational modeling has historically played an important role in understanding how these motors work. But, strikingly, most models assume the subcellular cargos have rigid surfaces. Simulating fluid surfaces is more challenging but more applicable to biological cargo. In this work, we build a computational model of molecular motor transport of cargo with fluid surfaces. Surface fluidity gives cargo transport new properties, like enhanced transport efficiency, and the ability to push against opposing forces. Because the effects of surface fluidity vary strongly with some of the properties of the cargo, like its size, our results hint at one of the ways that the same transport machinery can distinguish different cargo despite using the same motors.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic cell's microtubule cytoskeleton is a complex 3D filament network. Microtubules cross at a wide variety of separation distances and angles. Prior studies in vivo and in vitro suggest that cargo transport is affected by intersection geometry. However, geometric complexity is not yet widely appreciated as a regulatory factor in its own right, and mechanisms that underlie this mode of regulation are not well understood. We have used our recently reported 3D microtubule manipulation system to build filament crossings de novo in a purified in vitro environment and used them to assay kinesin-1-driven model cargo navigation. We found that 3D microtubule network geometry indeed significantly influences cargo routing, and in particular that it is possible to bias a cargo to pass or switch just by changing either filament spacing or angle. Furthermore, we captured our experimental results in a model which accounts for full 3D geometry, stochastic motion of the cargo and associated motors, as well as motor force production and force-dependent behavior. We used a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis to establish the detailed mechanisms underlying cargo navigation at microtubule crossings.},
