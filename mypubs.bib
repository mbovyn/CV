abstract = {Cellular cargos, including lipid droplets and mitochondria, are transported along microtubules using molecular motors such as kinesins. Many experimental and computational studies focused on cargos with rigidly attached motors, in contrast to many biological cargos that have lipid surfaces that may allow surface mobility of motors. We extend a mechanochemical 3D computational model by adding coupled-viscosity effects to compare different motor arrangements and mobilities. We show that organizational changes can optimize for different objectives: Cargos with clustered motors are transported efficiently, but are slow to bind to microtubules, whereas those with motors dispersed rigidly on their surface bind microtubules quickly, but are transported inefficiently. Finally, cargos with freely-diffusing motors have both fast binding and efficient transport, although less efficient than clustered motors. These results suggest that experimentally observed changes in motor organization may be a control point for transport.[Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text]},

abstract = {Molecular motors like kinesin are critical for cellular organization and biological function including in neurons. There is detailed understanding of how they move and how factors such as applied force and the presence of microtubule-associated proteins can alter this single-motor travel. In order to walk, the cargo-motor complex must first attach to a microtubule. This attachment process is less studied. Here, we use a combination of single-molecule bead experiments, modeling, and simulation to examine how cargos with kinesin-1 bind to microtubules. In experiment, we find that increasing cargo size and environment viscosity both signficantly slow cargo binding time. We use modeling and simulation to examine how the single motor on rate translates to the on rate of the cargo. Combining experiment and modeling allows us to estimate the single motor on rate as 100 s âˆ’1. This is a much higher value than previous estimates. We attribute the difference between our measurements and previous estimates to two factors: first, we are directly measuring initial motor attachment (as opposed to re-binding of a second motor) and second, the theoretical framework allows us to account for missed events (i.e. binding events not detected by the experiments due to their short duration). This indicates that the mobility of the cargo itself, determined by its size and interaction with the cytoplasmic environment, play a previously underestimated role in determining intracellular transport kinetics.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells transport cargos along microtubules to control their distribution within the cell and deliver them to distant locations. While we understand how molecular motors can transport cargos along individual microtubules, the cell's microtubules are usually arranged in a complex 3D network. While traversing this network, cargos need to navigate intersections where microtubules cross at a wide variety of separation distances and angles. To gain insight into how cargos navigate these intersections, we have used a recently established 3D construction technique based on holographic optical trapping to build single 3D microtubule intersections in vitro with relevant nanoscale precision. We then used these fully suspended microtubule structures to perform motility assays on kinesin-1 coated cargos. We find that some intersection geometries influence cargos to pass along their current microtubule, while other geometries influence them to switch to the intersecting one. To understand how, we use a 3D Brownian dynamics simulation of cargo transport to investigate the mechanisms which give rise to the observed switching probabilities. Using these stochastic simulations, we find that switching probability is often determined by a competition between a stronger motor team on the primary microtubule and the intersecting microtubule sterically hindering that team's progress. This understanding of the basic mechanisms of switching at single intersections in 3D helps lay a foundation for understanding how the cell may regulate switching to control how cargos navigate the MT network and ultimately their spatial organization.},

abstract = {Cellular cargos, including lipid droplets and mitochondria, are transported along microtubules using molecular motors such as kinesins. In the cell, it is unclear how motors are coordinated to achieve transport outcomes that are cargo-specific. One possibility is that transport is modulated by differences in organization and mobility of motors on the cargo's surface. We use mechanochemical 3D computational modeling to compare different motor anchoring modes, and find that organizational changes can optimize for different objectives. Cargos with clustered motors are transported efficiently, but are slow to bind to microtubules. Cargos with motors dispersed rigidly on their surface bind microtubules quickly, but are transported inefficiently. Cargos with freely-diffusing motors have both fast binding and efficient transport, although less efficient than clustered motors. These results point to a functional role for observed changes in motor organization on cargos, and suggest motor diffusivity as a control point for transport, either by modulation of adaptor proteins or changes in lipid composition.

Author summary The molecular motors of the kinesin family are responsible for moving the parts of cells to their subcellular destinations, organizing the cell interior. Computational modeling has historically played an important role in understanding how these motors work. But, strikingly, most models assume the subcellular cargos have rigid surfaces. Simulating fluid surfaces is more challenging but more applicable to biological cargo. In this work, we build a computational model of molecular motor transport of cargo with fluid surfaces. Surface fluidity gives cargo transport new properties, like enhanced transport efficiency, and the ability to push against opposing forces. Because the effects of surface fluidity vary strongly with some of the properties of the cargo, like its size, our results hint at one of the ways that the same transport machinery can distinguish different cargo despite using the same motors.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic cell's microtubule cytoskeleton is a complex 3D filament network. Microtubules cross at a wide variety of separation distances and angles. Prior studies in vivo and in vitro suggest that cargo transport is affected by intersection geometry. However, geometric complexity is not yet widely appreciated as a regulatory factor in its own right, and mechanisms that underlie this mode of regulation are not well understood. We have used our recently reported 3D microtubule manipulation system to build filament crossings de novo in a purified in vitro environment and used them to assay kinesin-1-driven model cargo navigation. We found that 3D microtubule network geometry indeed significantly influences cargo routing, and in particular that it is possible to bias a cargo to pass or switch just by changing either filament spacing or angle. Furthermore, we captured our experimental results in a model which accounts for full 3D geometry, stochastic motion of the cargo and associated motors, as well as motor force production and force-dependent behavior. We used a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis to establish the detailed mechanisms underlying cargo navigation at microtubule crossings.},

abstract = {The existence of strong absorption bands of singly deuterated methane (CH3D) at wavelengths where normal methane (CH4) absorbs comparatively weakly could enable remote measurement of D/H ratios in methane ice on outer Solar System bodies. We performed laboratory transmission spectroscopy experiments, recording spectra at wavelengths from 1 to 6$\mu$m to study CH3D bands at 2.47, 2.87, and 4.56$\mu$m, wavelengths where ordinary methane absorption is weak. We report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice, and describe how these absorption coefficients can be combined with data from the literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice and for CH4 in N2 ice. We anticipate these results motivating new telescopic observations to measure D/H ratios in CH4 ice on Triton, Pluto, Eris, and Makemake.},
